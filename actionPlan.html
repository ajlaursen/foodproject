					<h1>Action Plan</h1>
					<p>
						We are proposing a take home meal plan where children
						under 18 will be able to pick up a ready to heat meal
						from the school cafeteria. This will be available Monday
						through Friday. All children under 18 in Washtenaw
						county will be eligible for this program regardless of
						school enrollment. One of the barriers of most free or
						subsidized meal programs we have noticed is that there
						is a difficult or confusing process to sign up. We want
						to make our program available to anyone who is under 18.
						With this blanket approach we will be able to provide to
						kids that need it the most. They will not need parental
						intervention to get this food nor will there be any kind
						of lengthy sign up process or specific requirements for
						eligibility besides being under the age of 18. Any kid
						that walks into a school cafeteria can ask for a meal to
						be taken home. We believe that this process will allow
						as many children as possible to participate. We are not
						worried about kids taking advantage of this program
						because of the ability to only get one meal per child
						that walks into the cafeteria. We believe that students
						in more affluent areas will not take advantage of this
						program so it will naturally balance out if people are
						going from school to school to get more than one meal.
						We will distribute funds to schools on a reimbursement
						basis with an initial investment of funds to allow
						schools to start the program.
						<br />
						<br />
						With roughly 50,000 kids under 18 in Washtenaw county
						and an estimated cost of $3.34 And an estimated 34,000
						kids that would take advantage of the program we are
						proposing a $0.19 gas tax to cover the cost of this
						program. With a maximum of a $0.25 gas tax to cover the
						program if there were a 100% utilization for the
						program.
